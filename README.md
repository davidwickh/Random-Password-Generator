# Random-Password-Generator

I've started teaching myself Python and thought I would start to upload my proejcts onto Github. Hope you enjoy!

This is one of my first projects writing in Python, whereby the code define a random numerical and alphabetical based password. Some features of this code are as follows:

  - It allows the user to specify their desired password length between 6 and 25 characters long (this can easily be edited in the code       itself).
  - The code also asks the user to specify how many numbers they want in their password.
